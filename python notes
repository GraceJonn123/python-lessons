point to note...there are variables in python. You have to set them yourself.
when you assign a variable eg. my_int = 3, then i override it, my_int = 7, the second variable will be the new value.
whitespace is used to structure code.You should indent your code with four spaces.
indentation refers to the space  between the margin and the text.
