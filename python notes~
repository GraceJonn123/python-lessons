point to note...there are variables in python. You have to set them yourself.
when you assign a variable eg. my_int = 3, then i override it, my_int = 7, the second variable will be the new value.
whitespace is used to structure code.You should indent your code with four spaces.
indentation refers to the space  between the margin and the text.
To edit out a line you use (#), but to edit out amulti lines you use triple quotation marks.(""")
Arithmetic operations, including +, -, *, /, **, and %
addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, power of, and modulo(remainder).
learnt how to make a calculator by adding a few variables, a few multiplications and overriding.
Strings are surrounded by ""
\ is used to to show that its an apostrophe and not to close the string



you use the dot notation only for strings eg "marry".len()
integers use len(integer)

raw_imput(hello) will ask on the console hello
using (%s %)
this function replaces the statement with the string variable set for it
